# Graduate student mental health

This repository contains the code supporting DeYoung et al.'s manuscript comparing trends in U.S. graduate student mental health levels with those of the general U.S. adult population and a sample of education-matched adults. 

Some of the data used in these analyses are publicly available. Specifically, the comparison samples were created from the ongoing National Survey on Drug Use and Health available from the U.S. government's [Substance Abuse & Mental Health Data Archive](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/data-sources) (SAMHDA).  

Some of the data are not publicly available and need to be requested from the data producers. Specifically our sample of graduate students was created from the [National College Health Assessment](https://www.acha.org/NCHA/About_ACHA_NCHA/Survey/NCHA/About/Survey.aspx?hkey=7e9f6752-2b47-4671-8ce7-ba7a529c9934) - conducted twice a year by the American College Health Association.
