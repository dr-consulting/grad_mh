# Toy Data

Because the authors of the manuscript are not the primary owners of the ACHA data used in these analyses, we have created a simple toy model example that relies on mocked data to demonstrate the core functioning of our code. The `toy_model.R` file in this directory is modeled after the individual scripts for each target analyses present in our top-level `EXE` folder.
